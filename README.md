# es-summary
## A tool to summarize elasticsearch fields using composite aggregations, and then index the summary back into elasticsearch.

## This tool can greatly lower the amount of data one needs to search in order to understand if an index contains a certain value.

## For dryrun simply run the program, to have it write to an elasticsearch DB, add '--enable-write'
